Principal Components
=====================

We will use the `USArrests` data 



```{r}
dimnames(USArrests)
apply(USArrests, 2, mean)
apply(USArrests, 2, var)
```

We see that the assault has a much larger variance than the other variables. It would dominate the principal components, so we choose to standarize the variables when we preform PCA.

```{r}
pca.out=prcomp(USArrests, scale=TRUE)
pca.out
names(pca.out)
biplot(pca.out, scale=0, cex=.6)
```
